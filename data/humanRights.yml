        In developing countries, a staggering number of children grow up with facial deformities simply because they lack access to modern medical care. These conditions cause both physical and emotional suffering. However, thanks to Medical Missions for Children (MMFC) and their team of volunteer doctors, thousands of afflicted children have received life-changing corrective surgeries. The LFF is proud to support MMFC's mission lead by Dr. Noah Siegel of Boston, MA, to Antigua, Guatemala each year.

        It is Pro-Choice or No Choice! American women and their families are currently facing an unprecedented attack on reproductive rights. Anti-choice candidates and legislation, on both the state and national level, are threatening to dangerously restrict and deny access to legal abortions as well as the most commonly used forms of birth control.  Personal PAC is a bi-partisan political action committee dedicated to preserving these rights in Illinois by electing pro-choice candidates to state and local office. For 25 years, Personal PAC has been fighting for choice in Illinois and has been nationally recognized for its effectiveness.

        Bullying is a very real and pervasive problem faced by school children. RFK’s Project SEATBELT aims to make universal respect as automatic as fastening a seatbelt.  Launched in June 2013, Project SEATBELT has partnered with the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Safe School Certification Program to create conditions at home, at school, and in the community so that treating everyone with respect becomes the norm.  When children and teenagers feel safe and supported in their homes, schools and communities, they are significantly less likely to experience bullying.

        At some point during the 2012-2013 school year, 18,699 of Chicago Public School students were considered to be homeless.  The Homestretch, a film developed in collaboration by Kartemquin Films and Spargel Productions, followed three homeless teens as they fight to stay in school, graduate, and build a future.  As their stories unfold, the film connects to larger policy issues of juvenile justice, immigration, foster care, and LBGTQIA rights.  The LFF is partnering with The Homestretch in their efforts to collaborate with and build training tools for schools and helping them build partnerships with city agencies supporting homeless youth.
