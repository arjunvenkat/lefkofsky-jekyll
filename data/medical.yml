        The American Brain Tumor Association (ABTA) was co-founded by Liz Lefkofsky’s mom, Susan Kramer, in 1973, after her sister was diagnosed with a brain tumor. ABTA was the first national nonprofit organization dedicated solely to brain tumors.  For 40 years, the ABTA has been providing comprehensive resources that support the complex needs of brain tumor patients and caregivers, as well as the critical funding of research in the pursuit of breakthroughs in brain tumor diagnosis, treatment and care.

        Pancreatic cancer affects about 280,000 people worldwide, with a five-year survival rate of just 6 percent.  Those odds improve when the disease is caught early. So the Lustgarten Foundation places an emphasis on early detection research. However, the organization also funds studies to better diagnosis, treat and cure pancreatic cancer. To date more than $80 million has been allocated to fund 200 different research projects. And because Cablevision Systems Corporation underwrites the Lustgarten Foundation’s administrative costs, 100 percent of every dollar donated to the Foundation goes directly to pancreatic cancer research.
