      <p>Liz Lefkofsky is a leading social philanthropist committed to championing initiatives that enhance the quality of human life. Liz got her start in philanthropy as a young child when helping her mother stuff envelopes in support of the American Brain Tumor Association, which her mother founded. She went on to work at the Printerâ€™s Row Book Fair and Gallery 37 arts community, now known as After School Matters. Today, as the executive director of the Lefkofsky Family Foundation, Liz is an advocate of public education. She has created a unique partnership between Chicago Public Schools, the University of Chicago Urban Education Institute and the Academy for Urban School Leadership to launch <a href="http://uchicagoimpact.org/6to16/TheSuccessProject" target="_blank">the Success Project</a> which is now rolling out districtwide. Liz and her husband, <a href="http://www.lefkofsky.com" target="_blank">Eric Lefkofsky</a> established the Foundation in 2006 and became signees of the Giving Pledge in 2013. For over 10 years they have sought to advance high impact programs, initiatives and research in areas of education, human rights, medical research and the arts.
