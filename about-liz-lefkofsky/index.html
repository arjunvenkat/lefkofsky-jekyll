      <p>Liz Lefkofsky is a leading social philanthropist committed to championing initiatives that enhance the quality of human life. Liz got her start in philanthropy as a young child when helping her mother stuff envelopes in support of the American Brain Tumor Association, which her mother founded. She went on to work at the Printer’s Row Book Fair and Gallery 37, now known as After School Matters. Today, as the executive director of the Lefkofsky Family Foundation, Liz advances high-impact programs, initiatives and research in the areas of education, women’s health, medical research and the arts. Liz has spearheaded a unique partnership between Chicago Public Schools, the University of Chicago Urban Education Institute and the Academy for Urban School Leadership to create a performance-enhancing curriculum for students and online tools for them to select their best high school, a program which is rolling out districtwide. Liz and her husband <a href="http://www.lefkofsky.com" target="_blank">Eric Lefkofsky</a> established the Foundation in 2006 and became signees of the Giving Pledge in 2013. Liz serves as a board member for Museum of Contemporary Art, Ravinia Festival and Human Rights Watch.</p>
