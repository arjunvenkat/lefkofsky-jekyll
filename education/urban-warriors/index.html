desc: "Urban Warriors is a program of the YMCA of Metro Chicago's Youth Safety and Violence Prevention initiative. Urban Warriors provides a structured curriculum-based program that pairs experienced veterans with youth exposed to violence in some of Chicago's most dangerous neighborhoods. These two groups share common life experiences â€“ surviving in hostile environments and striving to cope. Together they discuss and process their experiences with violence, develop and share coping skills, and identify the strengths they have developed and how they can channel them to benefit their communities. This trauma-informed approach fosters a unique supportive relationship between military veterans and youth."
