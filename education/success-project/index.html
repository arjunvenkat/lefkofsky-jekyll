desc: "The Success Project, co-created by the LFF, aims to support students through the often challenging 8th to 9th grade transition by pairing the 6to16 Curriculum with on the ground Success Coordinators in 38 Chicago Public middle schools. With better academic preparation, social supports, and tools to help them identify the “right fit” high schools, The Success Project students will be set on their best path for success. This unique partnership between the LFF, the University of Chicago’s Urban Education Institute, Academy for Urban School Leadership, and Chicago Public Schools hopes to prove a sustainable model that can eventually help all CPS students successfully navigate this transition."
