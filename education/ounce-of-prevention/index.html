desc: "Collaboration has the power to make significant system changes that could not be accomplished when working in isolation. The Ounce of Prevention Fund, working to ensure that quality early childhood experiences lay the foundation for future success, has partnered with the University of Chicago Urban Education Institute, who strives to prepare all kids for college and career success, to develop the Birth-to-College Collaborative. The goals of this cutting-edge initiative are to improve outcomes for the 710 low-income children (birth to age eight) currently being served through this initiative, and to leverage this collaborative to transform the public education system for vulnerable children across the country"
