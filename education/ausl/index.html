      <p>AUSL was founded in 2001 to improve student achievement in Chicago's lowest performing schools. At the request of Chicago Public Schools, AUSL transforms chronically failing schools by providing new leaders, teachers, staff, additional programs and upgraded facilities. These enhancements lead to improvements in academic achievement, student engagement, and parental satisfaction. Today, AUSL has trained over 1,000 high-quality teachers, has transformed 31 schools, and currently impacts 17,000 children throughout Chicagoâ€™s South and West sides. LFF partners with AUSL as it works to boost and measure student achievement in the middle grades while providing support for a more successful 8th-to-9th grade transition. In 2017 the LFF hosted a pre-college shopping trip to help new graduates from AUSL stock their freshmen dorm rooms with basic necessities.</p>
