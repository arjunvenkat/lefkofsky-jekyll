      <p>The Academy for Urban School Leadership (AUSL) was founded in 2001 and its mission is to create schools of excellence by developing highly effective teachers and transforming educational outcomes for students in the lowest performing schools.  Today, AUSL has trained over 1,000 high-quality teachers through the Chicago Teacher Residency program, has transformed 31 schools, and currently impacts nearly 17,000 children.  LFF partners with AUSL as it works to boost and measure student achievement in the middle grades while providing support for a more successful 8th-to-9th grade transition with an eye towards college and career.  In 2017 the LFF hosted a pre-college shopping trip to help new graduates from AUSL high schools stock their freshmen dorm rooms with basic necessities.</p>
