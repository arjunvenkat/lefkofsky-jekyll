      <p>This year, 27 AUSL (Academy for Urban School Leadership) schools are currently participating in <a href="../success-project/">The Success Project</a> to providing support through the challenging 8th-to-9th grade transition. AUSL was founded in 2001 to improve student achievement in Chicago's lowest performing schools. At the request of Chicago Public Schools, AUSL transforms chronically failing schools by providing new leaders, teachers, staff, additional programs, and upgraded facilities. These enhancements lead to improvements in academic achievement, student engagement, and parental satisfaction. Currently AUSL serves over 18,000 students in 32 Chicago Public Schools.</p>
