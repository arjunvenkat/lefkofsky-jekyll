desc: "Young Women's Leadership Charter School (YWLCS) is the only all-girls public school in Chicago. Each year, YWLCS prepares nearly 350 urban girls in ninth to twelfth grade, with the necessary skills to graduate high school, continue through post-secondary education, and go on to lead fulfilling and productive lives. The annual pre-college shopping trip to help new graduates stock their freshman dorm rooms with the basic necessities is a favorite project of the LFF."
