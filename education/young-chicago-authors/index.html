desc: "Young Chicago Authors (YCA) believes that through words, young people can promote tolerance and remove barriers, transforming their lives and society.  YCA cultivates this belief by offering free weekly writing sessions, workshops, and in-school residency programs.  Louder Than a Bomb, the largest original poetry festival for youth in the world, is YCAâ€™s annual event where some 900 students from more than 100 schools compete in both individual and group performances."
