desc: "The LFF supported Citizen Schools as one of the founding partners who helped bring them to Chicago in 2012. Citizen Schools work with middle schools to extend the learning day for children in low-income communities. For two to three additional hours each day, educators work with students to improve achievement, explore opportunities in their communities, and make learning exciting. Twice a week, Citizen students participate in apprenticeships where they learn about potential careers through hands-on experiences. Currently Citizen Schools serves 500 students in six middle schools and is building their capacity to help their students successfully navigate the transition from 8th-to-9th grade."
