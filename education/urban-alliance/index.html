desc: "Urban Alliance empowers under-resourced youth to aspire, work and succeed through paid internships, formal training, and mentorship.  This is the only year-long employment program for high school seniors in Chicago.  After being selected through a rigorous selection process, Urban Alliance interns begin training for job placement. Once placed in a job, students work part-time with a job partner in the real corporate world.  The Urban Alliance interns continue full time in their job placement throughout the summer after high school graduation."
