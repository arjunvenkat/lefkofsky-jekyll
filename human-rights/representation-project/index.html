      <p>The Representation Project is a movement that uses film and media content to expose injustices created by gender stereotypes and to shift people’s consciousness towards social change. The LFF is proud to support The Mask You Live In, which asks: As a society, how are we failing our boys? Is our male population suffering due to our culture’s emphasis on power, dominance, and aggression? The Mask You Live In looks at the social implications of these cultural themes and how it plays out throughout a boy’s life. The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2015, and the MASK educational curriculum launches in Spring 2015. Both aim to inspire individuals and communities to challenge the status quo.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc45-ptHMxo" target="_blank">Watch the trailer</a></p>
