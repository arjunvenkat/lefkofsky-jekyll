desc: "Bullying is a very real and pervasive problem faced by school children. RFKâ€™s Project SEATBELT aims to make universal respect as automatic as fastening a seatbelt.  Launched in June 2013, Project SEATBELT has partnered with the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Safe School Certification Program to create conditions at home, at school, and in the community so that treating everyone with respect becomes the norm.  When children and teenagers feel safe and supported in their homes, schools and communities, they are significantly less likely to experience bullying."
