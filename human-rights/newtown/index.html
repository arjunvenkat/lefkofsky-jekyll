      <p>Newtown is working toward ending gun violence in this country by working with advocacy organizations to promote community screenings of its feature-length documentary, <em>Newtown: A Documentary</em>. The film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2016, sheds light on social injustices and evokes conversations aimed to change public policy on gun violence prevention. <em>Newtown</em> explores the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting on schoolchildren in American history. The film follows the Newtown, Connecticut community for three years after December 14, 2012, when the lives of 20 elementary school children and six educators were taken by a gunman.</p>
