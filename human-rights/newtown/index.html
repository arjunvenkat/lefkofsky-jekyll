      <p><em>Newtown: A Documentary</em> sheds light on social injustices and evokes conversations that are aimed to change public policy. Premiering in the US Documentary Competition at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2016, Newtown explores the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting on schoolchildren in American history. The film follows the Newtown, Connecticut community for three years after December 14, 2012 when the lives of 20 elementary school children and 6 educators were taken by a gunman. These stories share tales of grief and recovery with the profound desire to create meaningful change out of a tragedy that will mark this community for generations to come.</p>
