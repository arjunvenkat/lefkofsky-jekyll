desc: "In developing countries, a staggering number of children grow up with facial deformities simply because they lack access to modern medical care. These conditions cause both physical and emotional suffering. However, thanks to Medical Missions for Children (MMFC) and its team of volunteer doctors, thousands of afflicted children have received life-changing corrective surgeries. The LFF supports MMFC's mission led by Dr. Noah Siegel of Boston, Massachusetts, to Antigua, Guatemala each year."
