desc: "It is Pro-Choice or No Choice! American women and their families are currently facing an unprecedented attack on reproductive rights. Anti-choice candidates and legislation, on both the state and national level, are threatening to dangerously restrict and deny access to legal abortions as well as the most commonly used forms of birth control.  Personal PAC is a bi-partisan political action committee dedicated to preserving these rights in Illinois by electing pro-choice candidates to state and local office. For 25 years, Personal PAC has been fighting for choice in Illinois and has been nationally recognized for its effectiveness. Financial support for this organization comes from private funds outside of the LFF."
