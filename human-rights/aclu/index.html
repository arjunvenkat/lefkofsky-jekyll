Its advocacy is legendary in the areas of racial justice, religious liberty, freedom of expression, the rights of children and people with disabilities, criminal justice reform, fairness for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender individuals, and reproductive justice. A recent focus area includes regulatory, administrative and public advocacy to preserve and expand womenâ€™s access to health care in Illinois."
