desc: "Everytown for Gun Safety is a movement of Americans working together to end gun violence and build safer communities. More than three million mayors, moms, cops, teachers, survivors, gun owners, and everyday Americans have come together to make their own communities safer. Eight kids and teens die every day from gun violence in America. With a chapter in every state, Everytownâ€™s Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America is the biggest grassroots organization of moms working together to reduce gun violence. Everytown is calling on state and national lawmakers to enact commonsense gun laws, like SB1657, the Illinois Gun Dealer Licensing Act."
