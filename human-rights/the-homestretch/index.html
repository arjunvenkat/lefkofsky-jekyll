desc: "At some point during the 2012-2013 school year, almost 19,000 Chicago Public School students were considered to be homeless. The Homestretch, a film developed in collaboration by Kartemquin Films and Spargel Productions, follows three homeless teens as they fight to stay in school, graduate, and build a future. As their stories unfold, the film connects to larger policy issues of juvenile justice, immigration, foster care, and LBGTQIA rights. The LFF partnered with The Homestretch in its efforts to collaborate with and build training tools for schools and helping it to build partnerships with city agencies supporting homeless youth."
