desc: "Bullying is a very real and pervasive problem faced by school children. RFKâ€™s Project SEATBELT aims to make universal respect as automatic as fastening a seatbelt.  Launched in June 2013, Project SEATBELT has partnered with the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Safe School Certification Program to create conditions at home, at school, and in the community so that treating everyone with respect becomes the norm.  When children and teenagers feel safe and supported in their homes, schools and communities, they are significantly less likely to experience bullying."

      <p>At some point during the 2012-2013 school year, 18,699 of Chicago Public School students were considered to be homeless.  The Homestretch, a film developed in collaboration by Kartemquin Films and Spargel Productions, followed three homeless teens as they fight to stay in school, graduate, and build a future.  As their stories unfold, the film connects to larger policy issues of juvenile justice, immigration, foster care, and LBGTQIA rights.  The LFF partnered with The Homestretch in their efforts to collaborate with and build training tools for schools and helping them build partnerships with city agencies supporting homeless youth.<br />
