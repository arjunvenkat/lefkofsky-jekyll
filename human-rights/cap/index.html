desc: "The Center for American Progress’ mission is to improve the lives of Americans by playing a critical role in reframing the public discourse on a range of public issues through rigorous analysis, policy development, communications and outreach. CAP’s Women’s Initiative is a comprehensive program to ensure women are at the center of the national policy debates critical to the economic stability, health, and overall well-being of families and works to ensure that women, regardless of age, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, or sexual orientation, have the rights, resources, and agency to make healthy, autonomous decisions about their bodies and sexualities."
