desc: "In 2019, a group of national funders, led by the Womenâ€™s Foundation of California, launched the groundbreaking Culture Change Fund, a new collaboration focused on advancing gender and reproductive justice through long-lasting culture change. With the goal of shifting cultural narratives on gender, the Fund has invested in the multi-state Story at Scale initiative, which will deliver a data-driven and community generated narrative strategy that can easily be adopted by advocates, artists, and campaigners in their communications and organizing efforts.
