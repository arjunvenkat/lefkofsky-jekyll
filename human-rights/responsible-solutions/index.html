desc: "Former Congresswoman Gabby Gifford and her husband, retired Navy Captain and astronaut Mark Kelly, launched Americans for Responsible Solutions to encourage elected officials to stand up for solutions to prevent gun violence and protect responsible gun ownership. As gun owners, Gabby and Mark believe that commonsense protections from gun violence can prevent future shootings from shattering communities. Financial support for this organization comes from private funds outside of the LFF."
