      <p>In developing countries, a staggering number of children grow up with facial deformities simply because they lack access to modern medical care. These conditions cause both physical and emotional suffering. However, thanks to <a href="http://www.mmfc.org/" target="_blank">Medical Missions for Children</a> (MMFC) and their team of volunteer doctors, thousands of afflicted children have received life-changing corrective surgeries. The LFF is proud to support MMFC's mission lead by Dr. Noah Siegel of Boston, MA, to Antigua, Guatemala each year. </p>
