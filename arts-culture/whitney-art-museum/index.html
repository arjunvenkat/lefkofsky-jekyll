desc: "As the preeminent institution devoted to the art of the United States, the Whitney Museum of American Art presents the full range of 20th century and contemporary American art, with a special focus on works by living artists. The Whitneyâ€™s collection is arguably the finest holding of 20th century American art in the world. The Museum is dedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting, and exhibiting American art and has consistently purchased works within the year they were created, often well before the artists become broadly recognized."
