The outdoor music venue attracts nearly 600,000 visitors annually.  Patrons come to meet up with friends, picnic and enjoy the world-class musical performances. As a nonprofit organization, Ravinia has identified education initiatives for underserved Chicagoland communities as a key mission. Over 75,000 people are served through Ravinia's Reach*Teach*Play programs each year, ensuring that great music remains accessible to all."
