desc: "With 26 spectacular gardens on 385 acres, the Chicago Botanic Garden is a place of ever-changing beauty, with nearly 1 million visitors per year. The Garden, which opened more than 40 years ago, began as a picturesque place to stroll but and has matured into one of the worldâ€™s great living museums and conservation science centers. The Garden is a place where classrooms have no desks or walls, and where students discover the ways and wonders of plants, inside and outdoors."
