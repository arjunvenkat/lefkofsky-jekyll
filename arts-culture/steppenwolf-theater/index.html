desc: "Steppenwolf Theatre Company is a Tony Award-winning Chicago theatre company founded in 1974 by a collective group of dedicated actors in a church basement.  Nearly four decades later, the Company has become the nationâ€™s premier ensemble theater - redefining the landscape of acting and performance. Every year the Company produces 16 plays and hosts 700 performances, readings and other events. To support their ever-growing audience and education programs, Steppenwolf will begin work on a new facility with the completion date in development."
