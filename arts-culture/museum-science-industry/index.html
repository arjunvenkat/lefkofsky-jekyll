desc: "Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) offers the opportunity to tour a World War II submarine, experience live science in action, and feel the physics of natural phenomena like tornados and avalanches.  Through its Center for the Advancement of Science Education, MSI also aspires to a larger vision: to inspire and motivate children to achieve their full potential in science, technology, medicine, and engineering.  MSI was voted one of the “Best Museums in the U.S.” by the World Almanac for Kids, one of the “Seven Wonders of Chicago” by the Chicago Tribune, and named one of the “Top 15 Museums in the World” by Life magazine."
