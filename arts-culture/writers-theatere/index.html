desc: "For more than 20 years, Writers Theatre has captivated Chicagoland audiences with inventive interpretations of classic work, a bold approach to contemporary theatre and a dedication to creating the most intimate theatrical experience. Acclaimed by The Wall Street Journal as one of the top half-dozen regional theatres in the country, Writers has offered more than 90 productions, including 14 world premieres. Set to open in early 2016 the new Theatre Center, designed by internationally renowned Studio Gang Architects led by Jeanne Gang, is expected to enhance the visitors experience and the theatreâ€™s ability to bring even more sophisticated, high-quality productions to their patrons."
