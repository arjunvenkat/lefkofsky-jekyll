desc: "Founded in 1979, the Aspen Art Museum is a non-collecting contemporary art institution featuring exhibitions of drawings, paintings, sculptures, multimedia installations, and other visual media. The LFF supported the construction of the new Aspen Art Museum, which opened in August 2014. The new 33,000-square-foot space, designed by 2014 Pritzker Prize for Architecture laureate Shigeru Ban, helps further the AAM’s institutional mission to present the newest, most important evolutions in international and contemporary art. The museum’s education and open public programs, innovative exhibits, and community activities engage visitors in thought-providing experiences of art, culture and society."
