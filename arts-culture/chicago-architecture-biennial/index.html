desc: "Every two years, Chicago becomes the center of the world of architecture and design during the Chicago Architecture Biennial, the largest architecture and design exhibition in North America. The Biennial’s education program provides access to the Biennial for young people who traditionally have little-to-no access of involvement with architecture and allows them to experience the transformative impact of creativity and design. Through interpretive and educational materials, guided field trips, teen programs and a citywide student design competition the Biennial has reached thousands of young people from underserved communities."
