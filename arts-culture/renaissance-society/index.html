desc: "The Renaissance Society maintains an international reputation as one of the finest resources for contemporary art. The Renaissance Society's mission is to encourage the growth and understanding of contemporary art through exhibitions, publications and events. The Society presents art seldom seen in the Midwest. At the same time, the museum is equally committed to fostering the development of Chicago's own rich artistic resources."
