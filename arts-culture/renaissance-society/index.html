desc: "The Renaissance Society was founded in 1915 by University of Chicago faculty members as a laboratory of creative experimentation and a space of discovery. A non-collecting museum of contemporary art, the Renaissance Society has been at the forefront of presenting artistic innovation from around the world. It supports artists through the commissioning of new work and producing exhibitions, publications, and interdisciplinary public programs. At the center of all of the Renaissance Societyâ€™s offerings is the evolving question of what art is in the present moment, and what art can be."
