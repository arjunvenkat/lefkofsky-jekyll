desc: "Founded in 1879 as both a museum and school, the Art Institute of Chicago has long been recognized as one of the leading fine-arts institutions in the country. The collection encompasses more than 5,000 years of human expression and houses more than 260,000 works of art. Its mission is to collect, preserve, and interpret these pieces for the enjoyment of the 1.5 million people that visit the museum annually. In 2009, the Modern Wing was opened and provides a spectacular new home, designed by Renzo Piano, for the museumâ€™s stellar collection of 20th and 21st century art."
