desc: "The Lincoln Park Zoo is dedicated to connecting people with nature by providing a free, family-oriented wildlife experience. A leader in conservation science both globally and locally, the zoo exemplifies the highest quality animal care and educational outreach. The nonprofit zoo is one of the only free zoos in the nation. In February 2013, the zoo launched the Hurvis Center for Learning Innovation and Collaboration.  This center will use cutting edge research and programs to explore how zoos, aquariums and museums can most effectively engage their audiences."
