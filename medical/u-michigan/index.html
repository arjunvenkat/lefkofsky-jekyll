desc: "The Lefkofsky Scholar Initiative through the University of Michigan Health System was formed to further the development of cancer and heart disease research. The University of Michigan North Campus Research Complex assembles teams of leading scientists from different disciplines and co-locates them to foster synergies. The collaborative culture provides the Lefkofsky Scholars an environment ripe for connection and discovery. This program aims to provide brand new and unique opportunities to students whose research into curing cancer is considered particularly distinctive or unconventional."
