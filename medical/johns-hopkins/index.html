desc: "No other medical center in the world treats as many patients for pancreatic cancer than at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. They have taken the lead in the study and treatment of the disease. From identifying new pancreatic cancer genes, to exploring new and effective methods of treatment, the researchers at Hopkins are making an impact within the field. The development of a pancreatic cancer vaccine is progressing with the support of the LFF. Soon the vaccine technique will be available to help eligible patients who already have the disease and in the future help family members linked to the disease by heredity."
