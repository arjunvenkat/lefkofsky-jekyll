Every penny donated to Damon Runyon goes to support these young scientists, providing them with the freedom to explore new theories, try new paths and take high potential risks.  Damon Runyon alumni include 12 Nobel Laureates and leaders of major cancer centers across the United States. The LFFâ€™s grant  supports the work of Beverly Piggott, PhD at the University of California, San Francisco, in her efforts to understand the role of ion channels in brain cancer."
