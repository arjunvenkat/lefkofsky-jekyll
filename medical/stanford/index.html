desc: "Stanford Medicine is an academic medical center with a three-part mission: research, teaching and clinical care. Over the last 60 years its atmosphere of interdisciplinary exploration and collaboration has produced many innovations; the MRI, gene splicing and stem cell medicine were all born on the Stanford Medicine campus. Today that same atmosphere, amplified by the intellectual, technological, and financial capital that surrounds it in Silicon Valley, provides Stanford with unprecedented opportunities. The Lefkofsky Family Foundation is partnering with Stanford University to support the Oncology Division at the Stanfordâ€™s School of Medicine ongoing research of immunotherapy."
