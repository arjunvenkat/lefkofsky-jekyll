desc: "The American Brain Tumor Association (ABTA) was co-founded by Liz Lefkofsky’s mother, Susan Kramer, in 1973, after Liz’s sister was diagnosed with a brain tumor. ABTA was the first national nonprofit organization dedicated solely to brain tumors. For 40 years, the ABTA has been providing comprehensive resources that support the complex needs of brain tumor patients and caregivers, as well as the critical funding of research in the pursuit of breakthroughs in brain tumor diagnosis, treatment and care."
