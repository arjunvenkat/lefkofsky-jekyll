desc: "Hospitals can be scary for children, especially when they do not know what to expect.  The Shadow Buddies Program at the University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children’s Hospital utilizes plush dolls to help specialists explain procedures to children while in the hospital.  These teaching aids replicate the patient’s condition and help the child positively relate to the experience. The dolls help reduce anxiety for children prior to a procedure by preparing them for what lies ahead.  Many children bring the dolls back to the hospital for future procedures."
