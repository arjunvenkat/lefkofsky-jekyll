desc: "Pancreatic cancer affects about 280,000 people worldwide, with a five-year survival rate of just 6 percent.  Those odds improve when the disease is caught early. So the Lustgarten Foundation places an emphasis on early detection research. However, the organization also funds studies to better diagnosis, treat and cure pancreatic cancer. To date more than $80 million has been allocated to fund 200 different research projects. And because Cablevision Systems Corporation underwrites the Lustgarten Foundationâ€™s administrative costs, 100 percent of every dollar donated to the Foundation goes directly to pancreatic cancer research."
