desc: "Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago provides superior pediatric care at a state-of-the art facility, which opened in 2012. Although the building is new, Lurie Children’s Hospital has a 132-year legacy of excellence.  The Lefkofsky Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), located on the 16th floor, honors that tradition by caring for as many as 2,200 patients each year.  The LFF's long-standing support of Lurie Children's extends beyond the Lefkofsky PICU to the work of Dr. Stewart Goldman.  As the Division Head of Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplant, Dr. Goldman works in collaboration with doctors and researchers around the world to eradiate childhood brain tumors."
